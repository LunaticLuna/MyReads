# MyReads Project

This is a bookshelf app that allows you to select and categorize books. The bookshelf displays three categories:

* read 
* currently reading
* want to read

The app allows users to place books into different shelves, and search for books in the database using specific search terms (in SEARCH_TERMS.md) and place them on one of the bookshelves. The backend server are provided by Udacity.

## How to install

* make sure Node.js & NPM installed 
* direct to the projects folder and install all project dependencies with `npm install`
* start the server with `npm start`
